<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Yusuf Hamza and i am a Computer Information Systems (CIS) graduate with a strong interest in data, technology, and practical problem-solving.
   I graduated from Near East University in June 2023, where I developed a solid foundation in information systems, computing technologies, and the application of IT solutions to real-world challenges.</p>

<p>Originally from Nigeria and currently studying in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), I have gained valuable international exposure and adaptability through my academic journey.
   My background has strengthened my ability to work across different cultures and environments, while maintaining focus, discipline, and long-term goals.</p>

<p>I am particularly interested in technology-driven fields such as data analysis, information systems, and applied computing, and I am actively exploring opportunities for further study and career growth in Europe, especially in Germany and other EU countries.
   I am motivated by continuous learning and am committed to building skills that are relevant, practical, and in demand in today’s global job market.

<p>Beyond academics and career development, I value personal growth, health, and discipline. I believe in maintaining a balanced lifestyle that supports both mental and physical well-being. 
I also place importance on faith and reflection, which help guide my values and daily routine.</p>

<p>My long-term goal is to build a meaningful career in technology while contributing positively to society, supporting my family, and creating opportunities for growth wherever I find myself.</p>
